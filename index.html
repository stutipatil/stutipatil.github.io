    <p>
      The gender wage gap is a significant issue because it is unfair to women. Women on average are paid about 80 cents to a dollar men earn, and this varies with race. For example, African American women earn about 60 cents to every dollar a man earns. The gender wage gap is essentially the mean salary of women divided by men, which means that women are more likely to choose jobs that pay less. This is caused by the fact that women usually pick majors that pay less. The gender wage gap is also impacted by the choices that women make. Since women still do most of the work around the home, they tend to work less hours, which leads them to fall behind in work. All of these factors play a major role in the gender wage gap.
