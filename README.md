Activist Toolkit: Gender Wage Gap

This is my activist toolkit project about the gender wage gap. I really thought this issue was important because women make up a huge part of the workforce and they deserve to be paid as much as men. I decided to pick this topic for my activist toolkit project because I wrote an essay about this in school and I really thought that I could extend on that essay by creating a website.
